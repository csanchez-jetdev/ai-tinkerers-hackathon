    "abstract": "Most cancers exhibit aneuploidy, but its functional significance in tumor development is controversial. Here, we describe ReDACT (Restoring Disomy in Aneuploid cells using CRISPR Targeting), a set of chromosome engineering tools that allow us to eliminate specific aneuploidies from cancer genomes. Using ReDACT, we created a panel of isogenic cells that have or lack common aneuploidies, and we demonstrate that trisomy of chromosome 1q is required for malignant growth in cancers harboring this alteration. Mechanistically, gaining chromosome 1q increases the expression of <i>MDM4</i> and suppresses p53 signaling, and we show that <i>TP53</i> mutations are mutually exclusive with 1q aneuploidy in human cancers. Thus, tumor cells can be dependent on specific aneuploidies, raising the possibility that these \"aneuploidy addictions\" could be targeted as a therapeutic strategy.",

    "abstract": "Gene therapy has become a clinical reality as market-approved advanced therapy medicinal products for the treatment of distinct monogenetic diseases and B-cell malignancies. This Therapeutic Review aims to explain how progress in genome editing technologies offers the possibility to expand both therapeutic options and the types of diseases that will become treatable. To frame these impressive advances in the context of modern medicine, we incorporate examples from human clinical trials into our discussion on how genome editing will complement currently available strategies in gene therapy, which still mainly rely on gene addition strategies. Furthermore, safety considerations and ethical implications, including the issue of accessibility, are addressed as these crucial parameters will define the impact that gene therapy in general and genome editing in particular will have on how we treat patients in the near future.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease is caused by a defect in the \u03b2-globin subunit of adult hemoglobin. Sickle hemoglobin polymerizes under hypoxic conditions, producing deformed red cells that hemolyze and cause vaso-occlusion that results in progressive organ damage and early death. Elevated fetal hemoglobin levels in red cells protect against complications of sickle cell disease. OTQ923, a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9-edited CD34+ hematopoietic stem- and progenitor-cell (HSPC) product, has a targeted disruption of the <i>HBG1</i> and <i>HBG2</i> (\u03b3-globin) gene promoters that increases fetal hemoglobin expression in red-cell progeny.\nMETHODS: We performed a tiling CRISPR-Cas9 screen of the <i>HBG1</i> and <i>HBG2</i> promoters by electroporating CD34+ cells obtained from healthy donors with Cas9 complexed with one of 72 guide RNAs, and we assessed the fraction of fetal hemoglobin-immunostaining erythroblasts (F cells) in erythroid-differentiated progeny. The gRNA resulting in the highest level of F cells (gRNA-68) was selected for clinical development. We enrolled participants with severe sickle cell disease in a multicenter, phase 1-2 clinical study to assess the safety and adverse-effect profile of OTQ923.\nRESULTS: In preclinical experiments, CD34+ HSPCs (obtained from healthy donors and persons with sickle cell disease) edited with CRISPR-Cas9 and gRNA-68 had sustained on-target editing with no off-target mutations and produced high levels of fetal hemoglobin after in vitro differentiation or xenotransplantation into immunodeficient mice. In the study, three participants received autologous OTQ923 after myeloablative conditioning and were followed for 6 to 18 months. At the end of the follow-up period, all the participants had engraftment and stable induction of fetal hemoglobin (fetal hemoglobin as a percentage of total hemoglobin, 19.0 to 26.8%), with fetal hemoglobin broadly distributed in red cells (F cells as a percentage of red cells, 69.7 to 87.8%). Manifestations of sickle cell disease decreased during the follow-up period.\nCONCLUSIONS: CRISPR-Cas9 disruption of the <i>HBG1</i> and <i>HBG2</i> gene promoters was an effective strategy for induction of fetal hemoglobin. Infusion of autologous OTQ923 into three participants with severe sickle cell disease resulted in sustained induction of red-cell fetal hemoglobin and clinical improvement in disease severity.

    "abstract": "The incidence and mortality of cancer are the major health issue worldwide. Apart from the treatments developed to date, the unsatisfactory therapeutic effects of cancers have not been addressed by broadening the toolbox. The advent of immunotherapy has ushered in a new era in the treatments of solid tumors, but remains limited and requires breaking adverse effects. Meanwhile, the development of advanced technologies can be further boosted by gene analysis and manipulation at the molecular level. The advent of cutting-edge genome editing technology, especially clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR-Cas9), has demonstrated its potential to break the limits of immunotherapy in cancers. In this review, the mechanism of CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome editing and a powerful CRISPR toolbox are introduced. Furthermore, we focus on reviewing the impact of CRISPR-induced double-strand breaks (DSBs) on cancer immunotherapy (knockout or knockin). Finally, we discuss the CRISPR-Cas9-based genome-wide screening for target identification, emphasis the potential of spatial CRISPR genomics, and present the comprehensive application and challenges in basic research, translational medicine and clinics of CRISPR-Cas9.",

    "abstract": "The immune-suppressive tumour microenvironment represents a major obstacle to effective immunotherapy<sup>1,2</sup>. Pathologically activated neutrophils, also known as polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSCs), are a critical component of the tumour microenvironment and have crucial roles in tumour progression and therapy resistance<sup>2-4</sup>. Identification of the key molecules on PMN-MDSCs is required to selectively target these cells for tumour treatment. Here, we performed an in vivo CRISPR-Cas9 screen in a tumour mouse model and identified CD300ld as a top candidate of tumour-favouring receptors. CD300ld is specifically expressed in normal neutrophils and is upregulated in PMN-MDSCs upon tumour-bearing. CD300ld knockout inhibits the development of multiple tumour types in a PMN-MDSC-dependent manner. CD300ld is required for the recruitment of PMN-MDSCs into tumours and their function to suppress T cell activation. CD300ld acts via the STAT3-S100A8/A9 axis, and knockout of Cd300ld reverses the tumour immune-suppressive microenvironment. CD300ld is upregulated in human cancers and shows an unfavourable correlation with patient survival. Blocking CD300ld activity inhibits tumour development and has synergistic effects with anti-PD1. Our study identifies CD300ld as a critical immune suppressor present on PMN-MDSCs, being required for tumour immune resistance and providing a potential target for cancer immunotherapy.",
