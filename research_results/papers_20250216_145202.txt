Abstract:
Worldwide oral cancer is creating an alarming situation and it's a matter of global concern as it is the 11th most common carcinoma around the globe. After cardiovascular ailments, cancer is the next biggest killer. Approximately 90% of the total oral malignancies are squamous cell carcinomas. The etiological base of oral cancer is tobacco intake, smoking, smokeless tobacco (snuff or chewing tobacco), alcohol and areca nut intake, excessive sunlight exposure, reverse end smoking and Human Papilloma Virus (HPV). The treatment measures for oral cancer are very costly and affordability is low. So, taking preventive measures at the first place itself is of immense importance. Preventive measure is a multidisciplinary approach involving co-ordinated efforts from all the sectors of the society. The preventive measures are categorised into primary, secondary and tertiary measures. Along with the various screening tests employed to detect oral cancer the review focuses on biomarkers, melatonin, tea constituents, polyphenols, chemoprevention, Chios mastic gum extract, Poly (ADP-ribose) Polymerase 1 (PARP1) targeted optical imaging agent, and their role in oral cancer prevention and control. The review gives a brief outline on the preventive measures to be adopted to help prevent oral cancer and improve the quality of life.

Abstract:
An overview is presented of the epidemiology, etiology, clinical and diagnostic aspects, treatment and possible prevention of oral cancer. The dental profession may play a key role in the early detection of cancer and possible precursor lesions such as leukoplakia and erythroplakia. Since the use of tobacco is considered to be the main etiologic factor in oral cancer the dentist can play an active role in its primary prevention by informing his patients about the adverse effect of tobacco use and by encouraging patients to enter tobacco cessation programs.

Title: [Oral cancer: Risk factors and management].

Abstract:
Oral cavity is the most frequent anatomical subsite of upper aero-digestive tract malignancies. Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common histological type and totalizes more than 95% of oral cancer. Main risk factors are tobacco and alcohol exposure and also potentially malignant lesions. These precancerous lesions are a chronic disease of oral mucosa and are responsible for about 20% of oral cancer. The treatment of oral cancer depends on clinical, radiological and endoscopic staging and according to the multidisciplinary tumor board decision. Indeed, tumor staging gives information about loco-regional and metastatic spread. Treatment can include surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy. However, the prognostic mainly depends on tumor resectability and patient comorbidities. Tumor removal is often associated with reconstruction procedures in order to restore phonation, swallowing and breathing functions with acceptable aesthetic outcomes. The usual delayed diagnosis explains the poor prognostic of oral cancer in spite of prevention attempt and therapeutic improvement. Indeed, the profile of tobacco and alcoholic patients outside of medical system, the high rate of recurrence and the frequency of second primary malignancies explain the stable incidence for years.

Abstract:
Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the most commonly encountered malignant oral tumor in cats. The etiology of this locally invasive tumor is likely multifactorial. Several risk factors have been identified, including the use of flea collars, and a history of feeding canned food and canned tuna. Clinical signs vary depending on tumor location. The tumor commonly arises from the gingiva and mucosa of the maxilla, mandible, tongue, sublingual area, or tonsillar region. Maxillary SCC commonly presents clinically as an ulcerative lesion, whereas mandibular SCC is commonly proliferative, expansile, and firm. Lingual/sublingual SCC may be ulcerative, necrotic, infiltrative, or proliferative. In general, feline oral SCC is an invasive and malignant neoplasm regardless of its location. Surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy and combinations thereof have been attempted with rarely a satisfactory response. Currently, cures are obtained only in a small subset of cats whose tumors are amenable to complete resection, or where resection with microscopic residual disease is followed by definitive radiation therapy. A multimodal treatment approach likely offers the best chance of success. For cats with advanced disease, palliative care may improve patients' quality of life, albeit transiently. Sequelae associated with tumor progression and local tissue destruction often result in euthanasia of feline patients with oral SCC.

Journal: Dental update
Publication Date: 2015/Apr/01
PMID: 26076544
URL: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26076544/
Abstract:
A MEDLINE search early in 2015 revealed more than 250,000 papers on head and neck cancer; over 100,000 on oral cancer; and over 60,000 on mouth cancer. Not all publications contain robust evidence. We endeavour to encapsulate the most important of the latest information and advances now employed in practice, in a form comprehensible to healthcare workers, patients and their carers. This series offers the primary care dental team, in particular, an overview of the aetiopathogenesis, prevention, diagnosis and multidisciplinary care of mouth cancer, the functional and psychosocial implications, and minimization of the impact on the quality of life of patient and family. Clinical Relevance: This article offers the dental team a simplified overview of carcinogenesis, and a review of cancers that affect the oral region.

Abstract:
As the rate of new mouth cancer diagnoses continues to increase in the UK, awareness of risk factors and signs and symptoms remains low. This paper focuses on studies showing UK public awareness of risk factors, including alcohol, tobacco and human papillomavirus, as well as public understanding of signs and symptoms of mouth cancer. It includes a review of the effectiveness of campaigns in raising awareness of mouth cancer and examples of campaigns targeting other common cancers or risk factors that may provide useful learning ahead of upcoming mouth cancer campaigns. In addition, the awareness of the wider healthcare team and the importance of their role in identifying mouth cancer is explored. Current live campaigns in the UK are highlighted ahead of future initiatives now that the Mouth Cancer Action Charter has been launched and two new coalitions have been established.

Title: Oral erythroplakia--a review.
Authors: Reichart Peter A, Philipsen Hans Peter
Journal: Oral oncology
Publication Date: 2005/Jul/01
PMID: 15975518
URL: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15975518/
Abstract:
Oral erythroplakia (OE) is considered a rare potentially malignant lesion of the oral mucosa. Reports entirely devoted to OE are very few, and only two reviews none of which are of recent date have been published. Only the true, velvety, red homogeneous OE has been clearly defined while the terminology for mixed red and white lesions is complex, ill-defined and confusing. A recent case control study of OE from India reported a prevalence of 0.2%. A range of prevalences between 0.02% and 0.83% from different geographical areas has been documented. OE is predominantly seen in the middle aged and elderly. One study from India showed a female:male ratio of 1:1.04. The soft palate, the floor of the mouth and the buccal mucosa is commonly affected. A specific type of OE occurs in chutta smokers in India. Lesions of OE are typically less than 1.5 cm in diameter. The etiology of OE reveals a strong association with tobacco consumption and the use of alcohol. Histopathologically, it has been documented that in OE of the homogenous type, 51% showed invasive carcinoma, 40% carcinoma in situ and 9% mild or moderate dysplasia. Recently, genomic aberrations with DNA aneuploidy has been demonstrated. p53 mutations with different degrees of dysplasia may play a role in some cases of OE. Transformation rates are considered to be the highest among all precancerous oral lesions and conditions. Surgical excision is the treatment of choice. Data on laser excision are not available. Recurrence rates seem to be high, reliable data are, however, missing. More studies on OE are strongly needed to evaluate a number of so far unanswered questions. The natural history of OE is unknown. Do OEs develop de novo or are they developing from oral leukoplakia through several intermediate stages of white/red lesions? The possible role of fungal infection (Candida micro-organisms) is not clear as is the possible role of HPV co-infection in the development of OE. More data on incidence and prevalence, biological behaviour and adequate treatment are urgently needed.

DOI: 10.1016/j.jormas.2021.12.009
URL: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34933137/
Abstract:
OBJECTIVE: Metastasis to oral and maxillofacial region (MOMFR) is an unusual finding; representing between 1 and 1.5% of all malignancies in the maxillofacial region. A systematic review is presented to determine trends in presentation, diagnostic features, and patient outcome.
METHODS: Searches of databases were carried out for papers reporting MOMFR. The variables were demographics, patient symptoms, tumor location, tumor size, histopathology, origin of the tumor, immunohistochemical studies, follow-up and survival.
RESULTS: 696 cases were identified; 391 males, and 305 females. The most common race was white. The most common primary tumor for females was from breast 31.1% (n = 95), for males from lung 20.5% (n = 143). The most common location was the mandible 44.9% (n = 313), followed by gingival soft tissue 16.8% (n = 117). A frequent clinical symptom was pain with 17.5% (n = 122). The most common clinical presentation was a mass or tumor 37.4% (n = 260). The mean age was 58.8 years. The average time before diagnosis was 10.3 months, the mean follow-up after diagnosis was 13.1 months, and the average survival was 9.8 months.
CONCLUSION: MOMFR shows a strong predilection for the posterior mandible, with a mass or tumor being the most common clinical presentation. They are frequently painful, and demonstrate a poor prognosis.

Title: Oral cancer.
Authors: Gerson S J
Journal: Critical reviews in oral biology and medicine : an official publication of the American Association of Oral Biologists
Publication Date: 1990/01/01
PMID: 2129624
URL: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2129624/
Abstract:
In the U.S. oral cancer accounts for 2.1% of all cancers and 1% of cancer deaths. Two to three times as many males as females are affected. Blacks have more intra-oral cancer than whites, and their incidence and mortality rates have increased in recent years. The etiologic process very likely involves several factors. The major etiologic agents are tobacco (all types) and alcoholic beverages. Herpes simplex virus, human papilloma virus, and Candida have been implicated. Host factors include poor state of dentition, nutritional aberrations, cirrhosis of liver, lichen planus, and immunologic impairmant. Cellular changes include amplification of some oncogenes, alterations in antigen expression, production of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, and disturbance of keratin and involucrin production. Experimentally, cancer is readily produced on the hamster cheek pouch and rat oral mucosa. Unlike oral cancer in humans, most experimental lesions are exophytic, and they rarely metastasize.

Abstract:
CLINICAL/METHODICAL ISSUE: Oral cavity malignancies are the most common tumors in the field of ear, nose and throat medicine or otorhinolaryngology worldwide. It comprises a heterogeneous group of tumors, the knowledge of which is necessary to meet the different requirements of diagnostics and therapy.
STANDARD RADIOLOGICAL METHODS: Computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), sonography (US), nuclear medical procedures (NUK).
PERFORMANCE: The above-mentioned diagnostics are used in a complementary manner.
ACHIEVEMENTS: Early diagnosis of the tumor improves staging and thus the patient's therapy and prognosis.
PRACTICAL RECOMMENDATIONS: The radiologist plays an important role in the interdisciplinary treatment of malignant tumors of the oral cavity. Despite great progress in radiotherapy, oncology and immunotherapy, surgery still plays an important role in the treatment of malignant diseases of the oral cavity.
