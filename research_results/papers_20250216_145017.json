    "abstract": "Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) in non-smoking and non-drinking (NSND) individuals appears to be distinct from the traditional head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The incidence of this subset is increasing, as are the number of studies examining its characteristics. NSND OSCC individuals tend to be younger (<45 years) compared to traditional HNSCC patients. The proportion of females in the NSND OSCC cohort is also higher. The tongue is the predominantly affected subsite. Studies have revealed several gene mutations and unique epigenomic profiles but no definitive genetic etiology. Transcriptomic analysis has not found any causative viral agents. Other proposed etiologies include chronic dental trauma, microbiome abnormalities, marijuana consumption, and genetic disorders. There are international efforts to determine the relative prognostic outcome of this unique cohort, but no consensus has been reached. Here, we review the incidence, demographics, subsite, possible etiologies, prognosis, and therapy implications of the NSND OSCC cohort.",

    "abstract": "Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common malignant tumor of the oral cavity and its adjacent sites, which endangers the physical and mental health of patients and has a complex etiology. Chronic infection is considered to be a risk factor in cancer development. Evidence suggests that periodontal pathogens, such as Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Treponema denticola, are associated with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). They can stimulate tumorigenesis by promoting epithelial cells proliferation while inhibiting apoptosis and regulating the inflammatory microenvironment. Candida albicans promotes OSCC progression and metastasis through multiple mechanisms. Moreover, oral human papillomavirus (HPV) can induce oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC). There is evidence that HPV16 can integrate with host cells' DNA and activate oncogenes. Additionally, oral dysbiosis and synergistic effects in the oral microbial communities can promote cancer development. In this review, we will discuss the biological characteristics of oral microbiome associated with OSCC and OPSCC and then highlight the mechanisms by which oral microbiome is involved in oral oncogenesis, tumor progression, and metastasis. These findings may have positive implications for early diagnosis and treatment of oral cancer.",

    "abstract": "Head and neck cancer is among the top ten cancers worldwide, with most lesions in the oral cavity. Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) accounts for more than 90% of all oral malignancies and is a significant public health concern. Patients with OSCC are at increased risk for developing concomitant tumors, especially in the oral cavity, due to widely genetically susceptible mucosa to carcinogenic factors. Based on fulfilling specific criteria, these concomitant tumors can be called second primary tumors (SPTs), which can be further categorized into metachronous and synchronous tumors. This research reviews the literature that investigated the concurrent OSCC with second or multiple primaries to improve understanding of the definition, classification guidelines, and its effect on cancer survival. It also highlights the current investigation methods, the variation of standard treatment approaches due to such a phenomenon, and preventive measures discussed in the literature.",
